# Load the image

# Apply any necessary resizing, cropping, or filtering steps

# Convert the image to a suitable color space (e.g., grayscale, HSV, LAB)
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply image processing techniques to identify humidity-related patterns
# This step heavily depends on the specific indicators or patterns you're looking for
# Example: Applying a threshold to extract regions with high humidity indicator
_, threshold = cv2.threshold(gray_image, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Analyze the extracted information and derive a measure or estimate of humidity
# This step will highly depend on the nature of the humidity-related patterns in your image
# Example: Counting the number of white pixels in the thresholded image
humidity_pixels = np.sum(threshold == 255)

# Calculate humidity percentage based on total image pixels or a calibration curve
total_pixels = threshold.shape[0] * threshold.shape[1]
humidity_percentage = (humidity_pixels / total_pixels) * 100

# Print the humidity percentage
print("Humidity: {}%".format(humidity_percentage))
